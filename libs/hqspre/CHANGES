Version 1.5 (released 2019-??-??)
---------------------------------
- Fixed bugs in the (D)QDIMACS parser which led to crashs on invalid input files.
- Fixed a bug in vivification which could lead to a SegFault.
- Code cleanup.


Version 1.4 (released 2018-05-31)
---------------------------------

- Added vivification as preprocessing technique (currently using SAT-based BCP)
- Added unit propagation lookahead (UPLA) as preprocessing technique (currently using SAT-based BCP)
- Bug fix: The computation of a minimal set of universal variables which
  need to be expanded in order to obtain a QBF returned not always a minimal set.
- Added dependency elimination to turn a DQBF into an equisatisfiable QBF.

    Proceedings of SAT'17, Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol. 10491,
    pages 326-343, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-66263-3_21, Springer, 2017.
- Cleaned up the CMake build system


Version 1.3 (released 2017-09-11)
---------------------------------

- Improved gate handling:
  * Gates are maintained by the preprocessor in a dedicated data structure (hqspre::GateInfo)
  * Syntactic detection of MUX gates, including support for substitution and rewriting of MUX gates.
  * Semantic gate detection using SAT calls (we use Picosat by Armin Biere for that as it is one
    of the very few SAT solvers which support UNSAT core computation). Substitution of semantic
    gates is supported, but not yet rewriting.
- A few bug fixes, clean-up of the code; interface unified.
- Using easylogging++ as logging library
- Added a very simple QBF solver named HQSpre_solver as a wrapper around HQSpre, which
  iterates preprocessing, universal expansion and resolution.
